        <p class="explain">
            Our goal is to minimize expiring food waste from restaurant. 
            To achieve the goal, we designed a mobile application that allows 
            individuals to select and purchase an item from a number of other items; 
            while restaurants can post their left-over or other items with their preferred price.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
            While measures like carbon prices or buying an electric car are important, 
            they’re just not enough to meet the complex challenges of climate change. 
            After all, it’s not enough just to produce energy and maintain a livable climate; 
            we also need to distribute food, clean water, and other resources to all, 
            and preserve the natural environment that supports us.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
            Recent international science assessments have been clear: 
            to succeed, we need change that includes and goes beyond policies and private actions. 
            This means new laws, changing how governments and businesses make decisions, 
            as well as social change in how we all understand and measure success. 
            This is what we call systemic, or ‘transformative’, change.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
            The fact that we have reached ‘overshoot’ 
            just 10 weeks into the year is a clear indication that huge change is needed. 
            CoSphere, with our partners including the David Suzuki Foundation, Plastic Oceans, 
            and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, aims to bring interested people together to 
            identify what changes are needed. We identify six systems including economy and finance, 
            the levers to change them, including incentives and laws, and the leverage points at which to 
            apply them, including consumption. We then provide a platform and a community to enable these changes.
